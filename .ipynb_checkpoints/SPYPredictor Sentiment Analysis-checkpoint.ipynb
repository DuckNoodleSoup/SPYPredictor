    "For a significant portion of this project, I would like to focus on running sentiment analysis on the news headlines of a particular day as data to train the SPYPredictor. Broadly, I plan to take several news headlines on a certain day, run the headline through a trained model to analyse each headline, average the scores for all the headlines in a day, and use that result as the news sentiment indicator for that day.

    "This is definitely a much more difficult task than I previously imagined because of the lack of very convenient data. Data that is rich in the number of dates is not pre-labelled with 'positive' or 'negative', making impossible to train a model with that dataset, and datasets with labels are often irrelevant (being comprised of tweets or otherwise, not newspaper headlines), or are very limited in terms of dates. In order to curtail this problem the best I can, I am going to attempt to first, train a model with newspaper headline training data, and then use that model to label a larger dataset with 'positive' or 'negative'. Ultimately, I will use this self-labelled larger dataset to train the SPYPredictor."

The model takes a number of general rules that takes grammar and syntax into consideration, along with a preset list of lexical features, to predict sentiment in unseen text.
